			<h3>About <span class="light">Distribution</span></h3>
            <p>These maps are generated from data collected for the 'New Atlas of Australian Birds', the result of over half a million hours of surveys by more than 7,000 BirdLife Australia volunteers, whom we would like to thank for this fantastic effort.</p>
            <p>Monitoring of Australian birds through the Atlas project continues, and plays an important role in tracking the effects of changes on bird populations and habitats.</p>
